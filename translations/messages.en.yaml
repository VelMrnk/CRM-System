page_tip:
    profile: Set up your preferences to customize how Black Dirt Software works for you.
    users: Black Dirt Software allows you unlimited users (without charging extra) so you can better track who is doing what on your farm.
    plants: Here you can add or remove the different plants you grow. (Page automatically saves each time you check or uncheck a box.)
    gardens: Once we know what you grow, we need to know where you grow it. We recommend using numbers for your gardens, but you can name them however you like.
    notes: Use our notes tool to track the weekly tasks involved in running an efficient farm. Use our prepopulated list or click to customize.
    crops: If you accidentally end the wrong garden, or if you want to put two plants in the same garden, or if you just want to edit a crop, this is the place to do it.
    dashboard: Here you can see, at-a-glance and in real-time, how your farm is growing.
    tray_starts: Enter your tray starts and we’ll help you track your trays.
    plants_in_garden: Use this section to tell Black Dirt when and where you put your seeds (or transplants) in the ground.
        If you want to put a second plant in an already occupied garden, you can do that in %link%SETUP>Crops.%endlink%
    harvest_date: When a Plant is assigned to a garden with a Plant date, then the plant will appear on the Harvest date list.
        Record the harvest date here, and we’ll create a record of your planting cycles for better harvesting.
    end_of_garden: When a plant is assigned to a garden with a Plant Date, then the plant will appear on the End of garden list.
        When a garden is done, record it here. (If you end a garden accidentally, go to %link%REPORTS>Garden History%endlink%, click edit, and correct the mistake.)
    seeds:
        vendor: Enter your seed vendors here.
        order: Select the vendor, order number and date, then ADD your Seed Order. Once it’s added to the table below, select the PLUS button to add your seeds.

    report:
        plant: See everything that’s growing and sort it by plant.
        garden: See what you have in each of your gardens and how long it’s been planted.
        history: Use the filters up top to choose your garden. Each history will show you by year what you grew in that garden.
            If you’ve incorrectly entered something, use the edit tool to correct your mistake.
